# dash-ai-flubs
An exercise in creating a customized line chart using Python libraries.

I previously created this chart in Datawrapper:

https://www.datawrapper.de/_/LpjxR/?v=2

Then in Flourish:

https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/24516000/

To create the chart, run the app and then go to this address in your browser:
http://127.0.0.1:8050/

## TODO:
- Add files that clean Charlotin dash_table
- Change line color on plotly chart
- Add links (plus image) of Datawrapper version of chart
- Add links (plus image) of Flourish version of chart
